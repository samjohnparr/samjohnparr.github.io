    I am a Special Science Teacher I at Padada National High School—Senior High School Department and an Adjunct Lecturer in the Mathematics Division, Department of Teacher Education at the University of Mindanao Digos College (UMDC). My career is marked by a commitment to both teaching and research, with a focus on Computational Biology, Machine Learning, Persistent Homology, and Time Series Analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
    I obtained my Bachelor's Degree in Secondary Education, majoring in Mathematics, from UMDC, where I built a strong foundation in mathematical theory and its practical applications. I am currently completing my MS degree in Applied Mathematics at the University of Southeastern Philippines, concentrating on developing mathematical methodologies that address real-world challenges. My academic pursuits explore the intersection of mathematics and computational techniques, particularly as they apply to biological systems and epidemiological data.

    My research has resulted in several publications, where I have investigated the integration of chaos theory with machine learning to enhance the accuracy of forecasting and classification models. I also employ mathematical and computational models to study the spread of diseases, with the goal of providing insights vital for public health strategies. One of my key projects involves using persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis, to analyze epidemiological data, aiming to detect early warning signals for disease outbreaks—a novel approach in epidemic forecasting.

    I am a member of professional organizations and societies including the National Research Council of the Philippines (NRCP) under Division II - Mathematical Sciences, where I am an Associate Member. The National Research Council of the Philippines (NRCP), an attached agency to the Department of Science and Technology, is an advisory body to the Philippine Government on matters of national interest.
