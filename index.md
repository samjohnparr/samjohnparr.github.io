    I am a Special Science Teacher I at Padada National High School and an Adjunct Lecturer in the Mathematics Division, Department of Teacher Education at the University of Mindanao Digos College (UMDC). My professional journey is characterized by a strong dedication to both teaching and research, with particular interests in Computational Biology, Machine Learning, Persistent Homology, and Time Series Analysis.

    I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Secondary Education, majoring in Mathematics, from UMDC, where I developed a strong foundation in mathematical theory and its applications. Currently, I am in the thesis writing stage for my MS degree in Applied Mathematics at the University of Southeastern Philippines, where I am focused on advancing the mathematical methodologies that can be applied to real-world problems. My academic work reflects a broad interest in the intersection of mathematics and computational techniques, especially as they relate to biological systems and epidemiological data.

    My research has led to several publications, where I have explored the integration of chaos theory with machine learning techniques to improve the accuracy of forecasting and classification tasks. Additionally, I apply mathematical and computational models to study the spread of diseases, aiming to provide insights that are crucial for public health strategies. One of my current projects involves applying persistent homology, a tool from topological data analysis, to epidemiological data. This research aims to identify early warning signals for disease outbreaks, contributing a novel perspective to epidemic forecasting.

    As an educator, I am passionate about fostering a deep understanding of mathematics in my students, helping them to develop strong analytical and problem-solving skills. My dual role as a teacher and researcher enables me to bring the latest scientific insights into the classroom, creating a dynamic and informed learning environment.
